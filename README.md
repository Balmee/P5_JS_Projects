# P5_JS_Projects

## Introduction
The brief was to explore the reference libraray on the P5 JS version of JavaScript, the aim was to find someting new within said library and implement it into a design on the canvas, to produce a working module.#

## What have I produced
This project shows use of the Shininess method provided in the library. It was set this way to teach students who are unaware of the full library and what it can offer. with Shininess being one of them, the student will see how the final product is affected. the project shows the imitation of eyes tracking the mouse as it moves around the canvas; this is created due to an imitation light source emiting from the mouse causing a glow to the 3D spheres (via WEBGL) from said direction as a result of the shininess method which effects the range the circle glows.

## Key features
WEBGL: gives us the ability to export 3D shapes
locX and locY: give the fixed position of the two spheres on the canvas
specularMaterial: gives the shade of grey the sphere has remaining after the shine affect is implemented
shininess: gives the size of the initial glow effect on the sphere
pointLight: gives the direction the light source comes from, e.g. the mouse

## My Coding Experience
After exploring the p5JS references page, I collated a mood board of ideas for what to produce for my project, eventually settling on the idea of using the glow from the shininess method on two 3D spheres to imitates the effects of eyes following the mouse.When reading the different references for this project it took some understanding and time to reflect on what each method did to create the final product, as before todays brief, I didnt know the majority of the key features used, only using "loc" in a previous project.
